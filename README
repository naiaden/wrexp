Wrexp is an experiment wrapper suitable for launching whatever command-line tool you want. It takes care of saving standard output and standard error output to permanently available logs, and provides a full and colourful history of all run experiments. When the program/experiment you launched is done, an e-mail will be send reporting its success or failure (based on return code), along with fragments of the log. 

It is ideally suitable for running scientific experiments which may possibly take a long time to complete, and for which is important you have a back-log on how exactly they were invoked.

Each experiment is assigned a unique ID/name, which you always can use to view its logs.

FEATURES
----------------------

- Permanent logs of standard output, standard error output  (wrexp log , wrexp errlog)
- Colourful history of all run experiments (wrexp history)
- Process list of currently running experiments (wrexp ps)
- Log of resource consumption (periodic ps output)  (wrexp reslog)
- Log of system version state, customisable (wrexp versionlog)
- Periodic reports by mail on the status of running experiments


INSTALLATION
---------------
